***

# Overview

SysPeak provides as solution for constant system performance monitoring. The server constantly monitors for CPU usage, GPU usage,
network traffic, and hard drive usage. The intent is for the server to run in the background as a service for the OS.
The server provides a REST API that makes it accessible to any frontend or other API calls as desired.

SysPeak also provides CLI commands that interface with the server and provides a rich options-set to drill down to any
desired source.
